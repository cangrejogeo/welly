# Announcement

This fork contains Cangrejo's work on agilescientific/welly. This branch is just an announcement.

## If you are a new user

You probably want branch [2.0](/cangrejogeo/welly/tree/2.0).

Since some changes are breaking, there is [2.0bc](/cangrejogeo/welly/tree/2.0bc) which allows you to opt-in and warns you about deprecation.

## If you want to pull our changes into your repository

There are a series of feature branches called `agile:feat:NAME`, which are built directly off the original fork we made of agilescientific/welly. They should merge in easily.

`feat:NAME` branches are built off of `2.0` directly.

## If you're contributing here

Build your changes off of [original_fork](cangrejogeo/welly/tree/original_fork) if it seems convenient. 

If the changes are breaking, create a seperate branch with bc suffixed to push to 2.0bc.

`original_fork` is tracking agilescientific/welly, but rebasing all feature would be a lot of work.

Any other changes to agilescientific/welly that aren't coming from us will be merged in by hand.
