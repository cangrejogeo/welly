# Announcement

This fork contains Cangrejo's work on agilescientific/welly. This branch is just an announcement.

*If you are a new user*

You probably want branch [2.0](/cangrejogeo/welly/tree/2.0).

Since some changes are breaking, there is [2.0bc](/cangrejogeo/welly/tree/2.0bc) which allows you to opt-in and warns you about deprecation.

*If you want to pull our changes into your repository*

There are a series of feature branches called `agile:feat:NAME`, which are built directly off the original fork we made of agilescientific/welly. They should merge in easily.

`feat:NAME` branches are built off of `2.0` directly.
